# Music-Generation-using-Deep-Learning

## Important Points to Note : 

* We have taken all the files and combined them into one single file. So the model does not know how a song ends and how a song starts. It randomly picks notes and does not know that the ending of the song should be soft or the starting should be soft.

* We are taking offset as 0.5 always. So we do not have variable offset.

* The instrument considered in this project is Piano. The project should be extended to more instruments like Guitar, Violin and so on.
